# Customer Churn Prediction Using Big Data and Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms applied to a large-scale version of the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving a service and support business decision-making for retention strategies.
